  Please analyze and rate this resume and suggest how to improve it.
  The rating can be low if the resume is bad.
  Be thorough and detailed. Don't be afraid to point out any mistakes or areas for improvement.
  If there is a lot to improve, don't hesitate to give low scores. This is to help the user to improve their resume.
  If available, use the job description for the job user is applying to to give more detailed feedback.
  If provided, take the job description into consideration.
  The job title is: ${jobTitle}
  The job description is: ${jobDescription}
  Provide the feedback using the following format: ${AIResponseFormat}
  Return the analysis as a JSON object, without any other text and without the backticks.

//   Purpose

// This file serves as a core helper and configuration module for the AI Resume Analyzer project. It provides:

// Sample resume data for UI testing and demonstrations.

// AI response format definition to ensure consistent, structured AI feedback.

// Prompt preparation function to dynamically generate instructions for AI analysis based on job-specific information.
// Key Takeaways: syntax wise!

// export const → variable/function available to other files.

// [ ... ] → array, { ... } → object.

// : Type → type annotation, helps with type safety.

// Template literals `...` → multi-line strings and variable interpolation.

// Arrow functions (...) => ... → modern function syntax.

// Destructuring { jobTitle, jobDescription } → easily extract object properties.
